1. **GIT**: A distributed version control system that tracks changes in source code and allows multiple 
contributors to collaborate on a single project without interfering with each other's work.

2. **GitHub**: A cloud-based platform that provides hosting for software development and uses the **GIT** system 
for version control. 

3. **Repository (Repo)**: The container for a project in Git. It includes all of the project files and the complete 
revision history. On GitHub, repositories can be public in which anyone can see and fork or private where only selected users 
can contribute.

4. **Branch**: Represents a separate line of development in a **repository**. It's a way to work on features or 
tests without affecting the main, typically called "master" or "main" line of development. Once the work is finalized, it can be 
merged back into the main branch.

5. **Clone**: The act of copying a **repository** from one location to another, typically from a remote server,like GitHub
to your local machine. This allows you to work on the project locally.

6. **Commit**: The action of saving a set of changes to the **repository**. Each commit has a unique ID and is associated 
with a specific message detailing the changes made.

7. **Fetch**: The act of downloading commits, files, and refs from a **remote** repository to your local repository, 
without making any changes to your local files.

8. **Push**: The act of uploading your local **repository** changes to a **remote** repository like GitHub. This 
updates the remote repository with your latest commits.

9. **Pull**: A combination of **fetch**ing changes from a **remote** repository and then **merge**ing them into your current 
branch. This helps to synchronize local and remote development work.

10. **Merge**: The act of integrating changes from one **branch** into another. This combines the work of different branches 
together.

11. **Merge Conflict**: Arises when there are competing changes, like two people editing the same line of a file differently
between the merged branches. Git will highlight these conflicts and ask the user to resolve them manually.

12. **Remote**: A version of your project that is hosted on the internet or another network, like GitHub. It's a bookmarked 
destination to which you can **push** your changes or from which you can **pull** or **fetch** updates.
